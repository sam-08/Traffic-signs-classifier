# Traffic_signs
This repository contain a traffic sign classifier which classifies the image into 43 different classes. The dataset was taken from kaggle for the training of cnn model.You can find the dataset at the below link:

# Dataset
The dataset contains more than 50,000 images of different traffic signs. It is further classified into 43 different classes. The dataset is quite varying, some of the classes have many images while some classes have few images. The size of the dataset is around 300 MB. The dataset has a train folder which contains images inside each class and a test folder which we will use for testing our model.

# Approach

The approach to building this traffic sign classification model is carried out in four steps:

1. Explore the dataset
2. Build a CNN model
3. Train and validate the model
4. Test the model with test dataset
